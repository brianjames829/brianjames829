# 👋 Hey, I’m Brian (aka **Brian0xPi**)

### Systems & Smart Contract Security Engineering  
### AI-Assisted Auditing • Failure Analysis • Decentralized Systems

I’m a systems and smart contract security engineer focused on **AI-assisted auditing and failure analysis** in decentralized systems.

My work emphasizes **hands-on experimentation**, reproducible testing, and clear reasoning. I publish results incrementally, prioritizing **evidence, assumptions, and validation** over polished marketing artifacts.

---

## 🚧 Status & Proof

This profile documents **active security research and systems experimentation**.

Work is published incrementally, with emphasis on:
- reproducibility
- explicit assumptions
- failure and edge-case analysis
- AI-assisted workflows with human validation

Repositories and writeups show both **what works and what breaks**, including the reasoning behind fixes.

---

## 🧭 Current Focus

- Smart contract security analysis and auditing practice  
- Failure-mode discovery and invariant reasoning  
- AI-assisted vulnerability discovery with manual verification  
- Trust-minimized and adversarial system design  
- Publishing inspectable, reproducible proof artifacts  

---

## 🧠 Technical Stack (active use)

`Solidity` • `Foundry` • `Python` • `Ethers.js`  
`Security Analysis` • `AI-Assisted Auditing`  
`Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Foundational)`  
`Rust` • `Node.js`

## 🔍 How to Evaluate My Work

If you’re reviewing this profile:

- Look for **clarity of reasoning**, not volume  
- Review commit history and iteration patterns  
- Read writeups once published — they document assumptions, failures, and fixes  
- AI is used as a **tool**, not a substitute for validation  

This profile prioritizes **learning velocity and integrity** over appearances.

---

## 🎯 First Public Proof

The first published artifact will include:
- a minimal smart contract with intentional design flaws  
- documented failure modes and risk assumptions  
- a reproducible test harness demonstrating the issue  
- a written breakdown of findings and remediation  

This will be released as a standalone repository with a clear README and supporting tests.
