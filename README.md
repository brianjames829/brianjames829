# 👋 Hey, I’m Brian (aka **Brian0xPi**)

### Smart Contract Security • AI-Assisted Auditing • Decentralized Systems

I’m a smart contract developer focused on **AI-assisted security research**, using iterative analysis, testing, and verification to build more reliable decentralized systems.

My work emphasizes **hands-on experimentation**, transparent iteration, and publishing results as they stabilize — not polished marketing artifacts.

---

## 🚧 Status & Proof Roadmap

This GitHub profile is in **active build mode**.

I am intentionally publishing work **as it is developed**, with a focus on:
- reproducibility
- clear reasoning
- AI-assisted workflows with human validation
- learning in public without pretending finished expertise

### What exists now
- Cyfrin CodeHawks participation and security research
- Local smart contract testing and analysis environments
- Ongoing experiments in Solidity, Foundry, and security tooling

### What is coming next
- Public audit-style writeups
- Minimal, reproducible smart contract examples
- AI-assisted analysis pipelines with documented assumptions
- Small tools and utilities as they stabilize

> This profile reflects **work in motion**, not résumé padding.

## 🧭 Current Focus

- Smart contract security analysis and auditing practice  
- AI-assisted reasoning for vulnerability discovery  
- Decentralized systems and trust-minimized design  
- Publishing clear, inspectable artifacts as proof

## 🧠 Technical Stack (in active use)

`Solidity` • `Foundry` • `Python` • `Ethers.js`  
`Security Analysis` • `AI-Assisted Auditing` • `ZK Systems`  
`Rust` • `Node.js`

## 🔍 How to Evaluate My Work

If you’re reviewing this profile:

- Look for **clarity of reasoning**, not volume
- Review commit history and iteration patterns
- Expect work to evolve publicly, including mistakes and corrections
- Read writeups once published — they will document assumptions, failures, and fixes
- AI is used as a **tool**, not a substitute for validation

This profile prioritizes **learning velocity and integrity** over appearances.
