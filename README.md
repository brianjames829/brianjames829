# 👋 Hey, I’m Brian

### Systems & Reliability Engineering  
### Infrastructure • Security • Incident Response • Root Cause Analysis

I design, test, and harden systems across software, infrastructure, and distributed environments.

My work focuses on:

• Root cause analysis and structured failure modeling  
• Reproducible testing and validation workflows  
• Production stability and incident response discipline  
• Security analysis across application and smart contract systems  

I publish work incrementally with emphasis on clarity of reasoning, explicit assumptions, and verifiable results.

## 📌 Status & Proof

This profile documents active systems engineering and security work.

All projects prioritize:

• Reproducible builds and test coverage  
• Clear assumptions and documented tradeoffs  
• Failure-mode and edge-case analysis  
• Measurable fixes with verifiable results  

Repositories include both successful implementations and documented failures, with root cause breakdowns and remediation steps.

The goal is simple: make systems more stable, observable, and defensible over time.

## 🧭 Current Focus

• Production reliability and failure-mode analysis  
• Application and infrastructure troubleshooting (end-to-end)  
• Secure system design (auth, access control, trust boundaries)  
• Smart contract security as an applied systems discipline  
• Publishing reproducible, inspectable proof-of-work artifacts

## 🔍 How to Evaluate My Work

This profile emphasizes disciplined systems thinking over volume.

Projects are structured to show:

• Clear problem definition and scope boundaries  
• Explicit assumptions and documented tradeoffs  
• Iterative debugging and commit history transparency  
• Root cause breakdowns and remediation logic  

AI is used as an acceleration tool, not a substitute for verification or reasoning.

The goal is consistent: build systems that are understandable, testable, and resilient.

---

## 🎯 First Public Proof

The first published artifact will demonstrate structured failure discovery and remediation in a controlled system.

It will include:

• A minimal application or contract with intentional design flaws  
• Documented failure modes and risk assumptions  
• A reproducible test harness demonstrating the issue  
• A written root cause analysis and remediation walkthrough  

The repository will prioritize clarity, reproducibility, and disciplined debugging over complexity.

## ⚡ Ongoing Project

**Nightcoder Labs**

An ongoing systems and security initiative focused on:

• Applied failure analysis across software and distributed systems  
• Security testing and adversarial modeling  
• Tooling and automation that improve verification and reproducibility  
• Publishing inspectable engineering artifacts and case studies  

GitHub serves as the source of truth for all work and iteration history.
