# 👋 Hey, I’m Brian

### Systems & Reliability Engineering  
### Infrastructure • Security • Incident Response • Root Cause Analysis

I design, test, and harden systems across software, infrastructure, and distributed environments.

My work focuses on:

• Root cause analysis and structured failure modeling  
• Reproducible testing and validation workflows  
• Production stability and incident response discipline  
• Security analysis across application and smart contract systems  

I publish work incrementally with emphasis on clarity of reasoning, explicit assumptions, and verifiable results.

## 🧭 Current Focus

• Production reliability and failure-mode analysis  
• Application and infrastructure troubleshooting (end-to-end)  
• Secure system design (auth, access control, trust boundaries)  
• Smart contract security as an applied systems discipline  
• Publishing reproducible, inspectable proof-of-work artifacts

## 🧠 Technical Stack (active use)

Infrastructure & Ops:
`Linux` • `Cloudflare (DNS / TLS)` • `GitHub Actions (CI/CD)` • `Bash`

Languages & Scripting:
`Python` • `Node.js` • `Solidity`

Security & Reliability:
`Root Cause Analysis` • `Threat Modeling` • `Access Control (RBAC / Auth)` • `Failure-Mode Analysis`

Smart Contract Tooling:
`Foundry` • `Ethers.js`

Additional Exposure: `Rust` • `Distributed systems concepts`

## 📌 Proof & Evaluation

This profile documents active systems engineering and security work.

Projects are structured to demonstrate:

- Clear problem definition and scoped boundaries  
- Explicit assumptions and documented tradeoffs  
- Reproducible builds and test coverage  
- Failure-mode and edge-case analysis  
- Root cause identification with measurable remediation  

Commit history reflects iterative debugging and refinement — not one-shot uploads.

AI is used as an acceleration tool, not a substitute for validation or reasoning.

The objective is consistent: build systems that are understandable, testable, and resilient.

## ⚡ Ongoing Project

**Nightcoder Labs**

An ongoing systems and security initiative focused on:

• Applied failure analysis across software and distributed systems  
• Security testing and adversarial modeling  
• Tooling and automation that improve verification and reproducibility  
• Publishing inspectable engineering artifacts and case studies  

GitHub serves as the source of truth for all work and iteration history.
